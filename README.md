# Project Outline

### Overview
This website will allow users to buy and sell used cars locally. A visitor can shop by price, mileage, year, and type of vehicle. Sellers can list their car details and photos for potential buyers to see. The project could easily be modified for other types of products such as apartment/home rentals, etc.

I was motivated to build this when I was recently shopping for cars online. I wanted to gain experience building an MVP with key features using React with a SQL backend.

### Features
- User login: Users can create an account, log in, and change their password
- Post ads: Authenticated users can create a listing to sell their car with details and photos. They can delete their listing once sold.
- Filter/sort: Visitors and users can filter and sort listings by price, year, mileage, and type of vehicle
- Favorites: Authenticated users can save their favorite listings
- Admin: The admin can change a user password (in case they forget) and delete any listing

### Technologies
 - Node.js w/ Express.js web server
 - PocketBase for the database backend
 - Vite for React w/ Tailwind CSS for building the frontend
 - React Query for API calls
 - JavaScirpt, JSX, HTML, CSS, Sass, SQL
 - Deploy to VPS running CentOS (or compatible Linux distro)

### What I'll Have to Learn
This will be my first time using Vite, Tailwind CSS, React Query, and PocketBase. I've experimented with React recently, but I will still need to figure out the best patterns for implementing the features above. I will also need to determine how to best connect React Query to PocketBase as I'm not sure if PocketBase can receive API calls directly or if I need to work through Express.
