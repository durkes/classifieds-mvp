# PocketBase
The pb_data dir should be added to .gitignore to protect sensitive data.
For demo purposes, it will be included to maintain the initial database config.

### Production
The Linux binary is included in this repo.
Run `./pocketbase serve` to start the server. The admin portal starts on port :8090.
The admin username and password is admin@example.com (same for both).
